			 <!-- Current -->
            <p>My name is Eva Lieu. I was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. I'm a recent graduate of UCLA. I majored in English and minored in Labor and Workplace Studies. I have recently come back from a couple months of traveling in Europe and Japan. My passions include: reading, writing, traveling, and eating.</p>
            
            <!-- Future Ambitions -->
            <p>Currently, I'm interested in web development because of its potential for freelance work. However, I intend to join a company for a good number of years before I pursue being a freelance web developer in order to fund my wanderlust.</p>
